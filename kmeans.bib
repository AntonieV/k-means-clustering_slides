  abstract  = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40% of patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},

  abstract = {A cornerstone of modern biomedical research is the use of mouse models to explore basic pathophysiological mechanisms, evaluate new therapeutic approaches, and make go or no-go decisions to carry new drug candidates forward into clinical trials. Systematic studies evaluating how well murine models mimic human inflammatory diseases are nonexistent. Here, we show that, although acute inflammatory stresses from different etiologies result in highly similar genomic responses in humans, the responses in corresponding mouse models correlate poorly with the human conditions and also, one another. Among genes changed significantly in humans, the murine orthologs are close to random in matching their human counterparts (e.g., R2 between 0.0 and 0.1). In addition to improvements in the current animal model systems, our study supports higher priority for translational medical research to focus on the more complex human conditions rather than relying on mouse models to study human inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract      = {Common clustering algorithms require multiple scans of all the data to achieve convergence, and this is prohibitive when large databases, with data arriving in streams, must be processed. Some algorithms to extend the popular K-means method to the analysis of streaming data are present in literature since 1998 (Bradley et al. in Scaling clustering algorithms to large databases. In: KDD. p. 9--15, 1998; O'Callaghan et al. in Streaming-data algorithms for high-quality clustering. In: Proceedings of IEEE international conference on data engineering. p. 685, 2001), based on the memorization and recursive update of a small number of summary statistics, but they either don't take into account the specific variability of the clusters, or assume that the random vectors which are processed and grouped have uncorrelated components. Unfortunately this is not the case in many practical situations. We here propose a new algorithm to process data streams, with data having correlated components and coming from clusters with different covariance matrices. Such covariance matrices are estimated via an optimal double shrinkage method, which provides positive definite estimates even in presence of a few data points, or of data having components with small variance. This is needed to invert the matrices and compute the Mahalanobis distances that we use for the data assignment to the clusters. We also estimate the total number of clusters from the data.},
